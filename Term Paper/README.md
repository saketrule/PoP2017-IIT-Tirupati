###STATUS:


**UPDATE:**
* 31 mar Saket:

I've looked at code static analysis tools. Tried some single language ones. Found one supporting all languages we need: https://www.sourcemeter.com/
But it needs a proper project. I've been trying to use it, but having issues with the build script.
As for other metrics, I still don't know what other than --

- Number of lines of code
- Function calls
- Classes
- Some classes of coding convention violations.

-- can measure. 

*  Some old date:

Collected dataset: (Around 800 codes in 5 languages to begin with )in Uploaded to github : https://github.com/saketrule/hackerrank_top_solutions_dataset ,decided on performance metrics ,Installed compilers and profilers, Running test son dataset
                  
- >Comparing performance of different programming languages by studying different implementations of data structures and algorithms.
- >Comparing running times of programmes and comparing the running time of constant time operations.
- >http://www.rexxinfo.org/Rexx_scripting_lang_comparison.pdf  An empirical comparison of C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Rexx, and Tcl
- >https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0252.pdf

* Overleaf is still a stall since we're doing more work.
